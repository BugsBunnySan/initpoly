Nethack 3.6.0 initpoly patch

This patch allows one to select a non-default form when starting the game. With all the benefits and drawbacks that comes with.

You can also 'grow up', ala baby dragon -> dragon, or kitten -> housecat.This works both on your true form and a polymorphed form, even both at once.

You can, of course, still polyself into another form later in the game.

3.4.1 patch retrieved via the wayback machine (web.archive.org), originaly from:
http://bd-home-comp.no-ip.org/initpoly
and ported to 3.6.0
